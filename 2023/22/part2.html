<h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Disintegrating bricks one at a time isn&#39;t going to be fast enough. While it might sound dangerous, what you really need is a <em>chain reaction</em>.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll need to figure out the best brick to disintegrate. For each brick, determine how many <em>other bricks would fall</em> if that brick were disintegrated.</p>
<p>Using the same example as above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disintegrating brick <code>A</code> would cause all <code><em>6</em></code> other bricks to fall.</li>
<li>Disintegrating brick <code>F</code> would cause only <code><em>1</em></code> other brick, <code>G</code>, to fall.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disintegrating any other brick would cause <em>no other bricks</em> to fall. So, in this example, the sum of <em>the number of other bricks that would fall</em> as a result of disintegrating each brick is <code><em>7</em></code>.</p>
<p>For each brick, determine how many <em>other bricks</em> would fall if that brick were disintegrated. <em>What is the sum of the number of other bricks that would fall?</em></p>
