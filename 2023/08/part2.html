<h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>The <span title="Duhduhduhduhduh! Dah, duhduhduhduhduh!">sandstorm</span> is upon you and you aren&#39;t any closer to escaping the wasteland. You had the camel follow the instructions, but you&#39;ve barely left your starting position. It&#39;s going to take <em>significantly more steps</em> to escape!</p>
<p>What if the map isn&#39;t for people - what if the map is for <em>ghosts</em>? Are ghosts even bound by the laws of spacetime? Only one way to find out.</p>
<p>After examining the maps a bit longer, your attention is drawn to a curious fact: the number of nodes with names ending in <code>A</code> is equal to the number ending in <code>Z</code>! If you were a ghost, you&#39;d probably just <em>start at every node that ends with <code>A</code></em> and follow all of the paths at the same time until they all simultaneously end up at nodes that end with <code>Z</code>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>LR

11A = (11B, XXX)
11B = (XXX, 11Z)
11Z = (11B, XXX)
22A = (22B, XXX)
22B = (22C, 22C)
22C = (22Z, 22Z)
22Z = (22B, 22B)
XXX = (XXX, XXX)
</code></pre>
<p>Here, there are two starting nodes, <code>11A</code> and <code>22A</code> (because they both end with <code>A</code>). As you follow each left/right instruction, use that instruction to <em>simultaneously</em> navigate away from both nodes you&#39;re currently on. Repeat this process until <em>all</em> of the nodes you&#39;re currently on end with <code>Z</code>. (If only some of the nodes you&#39;re on end with <code>Z</code>, they act like any other node and you continue as normal.) In this example, you would proceed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 0: You are at <code>11A</code> and <code>22A</code>.</li>
<li>Step 1: You choose all of the <em>left</em> paths, leading you to <code>11B</code> and <code>22B</code>.</li>
<li>Step 2: You choose all of the <em>right</em> paths, leading you to <code><em>11Z</em></code> and <code>22C</code>.</li>
<li>Step 3: You choose all of the <em>left</em> paths, leading you to <code>11B</code> and <code><em>22Z</em></code>.</li>
<li>Step 4: You choose all of the <em>right</em> paths, leading you to <code><em>11Z</em></code> and <code>22B</code>.</li>
<li>Step 5: You choose all of the <em>left</em> paths, leading you to <code>11B</code> and <code>22C</code>.</li>
<li>Step 6: You choose all of the <em>right</em> paths, leading you to <code><em>11Z</em></code> and <code><em>22Z</em></code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in this example, you end up entirely on nodes that end in <code>Z</code> after <code><em>6</em></code> steps.</p>
<p>Simultaneously start on every node that ends with <code>A</code>. <em>How many steps does it take before you&#39;re only on nodes that end with <code>Z</code>?</em></p>
