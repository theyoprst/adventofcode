<h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Even with your help, the sorting process <em>still</em> isn&#39;t fast enough.</p>
<p>One of the Elves comes up with a new plan: rather than sort parts individually through all of these workflows, maybe you can figure out in advance which combinations of ratings will be accepted or rejected.</p>
<p>Each of the four ratings (<code>x</code>, <code>m</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>s</code>) can have an integer value ranging from a minimum of <code>1</code> to a maximum of <code>4000</code>. Of <em>all possible distinct combinations</em> of ratings, your job is to figure out which ones will be <em>accepted</em>.</p>
<p>In the above example, there are <code><em>167409079868000</em></code> distinct combinations of ratings that will be accepted.</p>
<p>Consider only your list of workflows; the list of part ratings that the Elves wanted you to sort is no longer relevant. <em>How many distinct combinations of ratings will be accepted by the Elves&#39; workflows?</em></p>
