<h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Upon further analysis, it doesn&#39;t seem like <em>any</em> hailstones will naturally collide. It&#39;s up to you to fix that!</p>
<p>You find a rock on the ground nearby. While it seems extremely unlikely, if you throw it just right, you should be able to <em>hit every hailstone in a single throw</em>!</p>
<p>You can use the probably-magical winds to reach <em>any integer position</em> you like and to propel the rock at <em>any integer velocity</em>. Now <em>including the Z axis</em> in your calculations, if you throw the rock at time <code>0</code>, where do you need to be so that the rock <em>perfectly collides with every hailstone</em>? Due to <span title="What, you&#39;ve never studied probably-magical physics?">probably-magical inertia</span>, the rock won&#39;t slow down or change direction when it collides with a hailstone.</p>
<p>In the example above, you can achieve this by moving to position <code>24, 13, 10</code> and throwing the rock at velocity <code>-3, 1, 2</code>. If you do this, you will hit every hailstone as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Hailstone: 19, 13, 30 @ -2, 1, -2
Collision time: 5
Collision position: 9, 18, 20

Hailstone: 18, 19, 22 @ -1, -1, -2
Collision time: 3
Collision position: 15, 16, 16

Hailstone: 20, 25, 34 @ -2, -2, -4
Collision time: 4
Collision position: 12, 17, 18

Hailstone: 12, 31, 28 @ -1, -2, -1
Collision time: 6
Collision position: 6, 19, 22

Hailstone: 20, 19, 15 @ 1, -5, -3
Collision time: 1
Collision position: 21, 14, 12
</code></pre>
<p>Above, each hailstone is identified by its initial position and its velocity. Then, the time and position of that hailstone&#39;s collision with your rock are given.</p>
<p>After 1 nanosecond, the rock has <em>exactly the same position</em> as one of the hailstones, obliterating it into ice dust! Another hailstone is smashed to bits two nanoseconds after that. After a total of 6 nanoseconds, all of the hailstones have been destroyed.</p>
<p>So, at time <code>0</code>, the rock needs to be at X position <code>24</code>, Y position <code>13</code>, and Z position <code>10</code>. Adding these three coordinates together produces <code><em>47</em></code>. (Don&#39;t add any coordinates from the rock&#39;s velocity.)</p>
<p>Determine the exact position and velocity the rock needs to have at time <code>0</code> so that it perfectly collides with every hailstone. <em>What do you get if you add up the X, Y, and Z coordinates of that initial position?</em></p>
