<h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>You resume walking through the valley of mirrors and - <em>SMACK!</em> - run directly into one. Hopefully <span title="Sorry, Nobody saw that.">nobody</span> was watching, because that must have been pretty embarrassing.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, you discover that every mirror has exactly one <em>smudge</em>: exactly one <code>.</code> or <code>#</code> should be the opposite type.</p>
<p>In each pattern, you&#39;ll need to locate and fix the smudge that causes a <em>different reflection line</em> to be valid. (The old reflection line won&#39;t necessarily continue being valid after the smudge is fixed.)</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the above example again:</p>
<pre><code>#.##..##.
..#.##.#.
##......#
##......#
..#.##.#.
..##..##.
#.#.##.#.

#...##..#
#....#..#
..##..###
#####.##.
#####.##.
..##..###
#....#..#
</code></pre>
<p>The first pattern&#39;s smudge is in the top-left corner. If the top-left <code>#</code> were instead <code>.</code>, it would have a different, horizontal line of reflection:</p>
<pre><code>1 ..##..##. 1
2 ..#.##.#. 2
3v##......#v3
4^##......#^4
5 ..#.##.#. 5
6 ..##..##. 6
7 #.#.##.#. 7
</code></pre>
<p>With the smudge in the top-left corner repaired, a new horizontal line of reflection between rows 3 and 4 now exists. Row 7 has no corresponding reflected row and can be ignored, but every other row matches exactly: row 1 matches row 6, row 2 matches row 5, and row 3 matches row 4.</p>
<p>In the second pattern, the smudge can be fixed by changing the fifth symbol on row 2 from <code>.</code> to <code>#</code>:</p>
<pre><code>1v#...##..#v1
2^#...##..#^2
3 ..##..### 3
4 #####.##. 4
5 #####.##. 5
6 ..##..### 6
7 #....#..# 7
</code></pre>
<p>Now, the pattern has a different horizontal line of reflection between rows 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Summarize your notes as before, but instead use the new different reflection lines. In this example, the first pattern&#39;s new horizontal line has 3 rows above it and the second pattern&#39;s new horizontal line has 1 row above it, summarizing to the value <code><em>400</em></code>.</p>
<p>In each pattern, fix the smudge and find the different line of reflection. <em>What number do you get after summarizing the new reflection line in each pattern in your notes?</em></p>
