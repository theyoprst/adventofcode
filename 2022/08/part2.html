<h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Content with the amount of tree cover available, the Elves just need to know the best spot to build their tree house: they would like to be able to see a lot of <em>trees</em>.</p>
<p>To measure the viewing distance from a given tree, look up, down, left, and right from that tree; stop if you reach an edge or at the first tree that is the same height or taller than the tree under consideration. (If a tree is right on the edge, at least one of its viewing distances will be zero.)</p>
<p>The Elves don&#39;t care about distant trees taller than those found by the rules above; the proposed tree house has large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaves" target="_blank">eaves</a> to keep it dry, so they wouldn&#39;t be able to see higher than the tree house anyway.</p>
<p>In the example above, consider the middle <code>5</code> in the second row:</p>
<pre><code>30373
25<em>5</em>12
65332
33549
35390
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Looking up, its view is not blocked; it can see <code><em>1</em></code> tree (of height <code>3</code>).</li>
<li>Looking left, its view is blocked immediately; it can see only <code><em>1</em></code> tree (of height <code>5</code>, right next to it).</li>
<li>Looking right, its view is not blocked; it can see <code><em>2</em></code> trees.</li>
<li>Looking down, its view is blocked eventually; it can see <code><em>2</em></code> trees (one of height <code>3</code>, then the tree of height <code>5</code> that blocks its view).</li>
</ul>
<p>A tree&#39;s <em>scenic score</em> is found by <em>multiplying together</em> its viewing distance in each of the four directions. For this tree, this is <code><em>4</em></code> (found by multiplying <code>1 * 1 * 2 * 2</code>).</p>
<p>However, you can do even better: consider the tree of height <code>5</code> in the middle of the fourth row:</p>
<pre><code>30373
25512
65332
33<em>5</em>49
35390
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Looking up, its view is blocked at <code><em>2</em></code> trees (by another tree with a height of <code>5</code>).</li>
<li>Looking left, its view is not blocked; it can see <code><em>2</em></code> trees.</li>
<li>Looking down, its view is also not blocked; it can see <code><em>1</em></code> tree.</li>
<li>Looking right, its view is blocked at <code><em>2</em></code> trees (by a massive tree of height <code>9</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>This tree&#39;s scenic score is <code><em>8</em></code> (<code>2 * 2 * 1 * 2</code>); this is the ideal spot for the tree house.</p>
<p>Consider each tree on your map. <em>What is the highest scenic score possible for any tree?</em></p>
