<h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>You&#39;re worried you might not ever get your items back. So worried, in fact, that your relief that a monkey&#39;s inspection didn&#39;t damage an item <em>no longer causes your worry level to be divided by three</em>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that relief was all that was keeping your worry levels from reaching <em>ridiculous levels</em>. You&#39;ll need to <em>find another way to keep your worry levels manageable</em>.</p>
<p>At this rate, you might be putting up with these monkeys for a <em>very long time</em> - possibly <em><code>10000</code> rounds</em>!</p>
<p>With these new rules, you can still figure out the <span title="Monkey business monkey business monkey business, monkey numbers... is this working?">monkey business</span> after 10000 rounds. Using the same example above:</p>
<pre><code>== After round 1 ==
Monkey 0 inspected items 2 times.
Monkey 1 inspected items 4 times.
Monkey 2 inspected items 3 times.
Monkey 3 inspected items 6 times.

== After round 20 ==

Monkey 1 inspected items 4792 times.
Monkey 2 inspected items 199 times.
Monkey 3 inspected items 5192 times.

== After round 2000 ==
Monkey 0 inspected items 10419 times.
Monkey 1 inspected items 9577 times.
Monkey 2 inspected items 392 times.
Monkey 3 inspected items 10391 times.

== After round 3000 ==
Monkey 0 inspected items 15638 times.
Monkey 1 inspected items 14358 times.
Monkey 2 inspected items 587 times.
Monkey 3 inspected items 15593 times.

== After round 4000 ==
Monkey 0 inspected items 20858 times.
Monkey 1 inspected items 19138 times.
Monkey 2 inspected items 780 times.
Monkey 3 inspected items 20797 times.

== After round 5000 ==
Monkey 0 inspected items 26075 times.
Monkey 1 inspected items 23921 times.
Monkey 2 inspected items 974 times.
Monkey 3 inspected items 26000 times.

== After round 6000 ==
Monkey 0 inspected items 31294 times.
Monkey 1 inspected items 28702 times.

== After round 7000 ==
Monkey 0 inspected items 36508 times.
Monkey 1 inspected items 33488 times.
Monkey 2 inspected items 1360 times.
Monkey 3 inspected items 36400 times.

== After round 8000 ==
Monkey 0 inspected items 41728 times.
Monkey 1 inspected items 38268 times.
Monkey 2 inspected items 1553 times.
Monkey 3 inspected items 41606 times.

== After round 9000 ==
Monkey 0 inspected items 46945 times.
Monkey 1 inspected items 43051 times.
Monkey 2 inspected items 1746 times.
Monkey 3 inspected items 46807 times.

== After round 10000 ==
<em>Monkey 0 inspected items 52166 times.</em>
Monkey 1 inspected items 47830 times.
Monkey 2 inspected items 1938 times.
<em>Monkey 3 inspected items 52013 times.</em>
</code></pre>
<p>After 10000 rounds, the two most active monkeys inspected items 52166 and 52013 times. Multiplying these together, the level of <em>monkey business</em> in this situation is now <code><em>2713310158</em></code>.</p>
<p>Worry levels are no longer divided by three after each item is inspected; you&#39;ll need to find another way to keep your worry levels manageable. Starting again from the initial state in your puzzle input, <em>what is the level of monkey business after 10000 rounds?</em></p>
